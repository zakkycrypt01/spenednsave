## 🎯 Overview

### The Problem

Traditional crypto wallets have a critical flaw: lose your private key, and your funds are gone forever. Multi-sig wallets solve this but are complex and expensive to set up.

### The Solution

SpendGuard combines the security of multi-signature wallets with the simplicity of social recovery:

- **Saver Mode**: You control a vault that requires guardian approval for withdrawals
- **Guardian Mode**: Trusted friends hold non-transferable tokens (SBTs) that give them voting power
- **Quorum-Based**: Set how many guardians must approve (e.g., 2-of-3, 3-of-5)
- **Emergency Access**: 30-day timelock for solo withdrawals in case guardians are unavailable
- **Built on Base**: Low fees, fast transactions, Ethereum-level security

### Use Cases

- 💰 **Savings Protection**: Lock away funds that require friend approval to spend
- 🏦 **Treasury Management**: Shared funds for DAOs, families, or groups
- 🎯 **Spending Accountability**: Gamify savings by adding friction to impulse purchases
- 🚨 **Emergency Recovery**: Access funds even if guardians disappear (after 30 days)

---


## 📝 Changelog

- **2026-01-17**: Cleaned up dependencies and removed test files for frontend-only production build
- **2026-01-16**: Added GuardianBadge and GuardianSBT contracts with comprehensive test coverage
- **2026-01-15**: Email notification system integration with SMTP/Resend API support
- **2026-01-14**: Fixed Activity Log total deposits calculation and display. Now always sums as `bigint` and shows up to 5 decimal places for ETH values.

## ✨ Features


### Email Notifications

- ✅ **Email Notifications**: Owners and guardians can opt-in to receive email alerts for important events (withdrawal requests, approvals, rejections, execution, and emergency unlocks). Preferences are managed in the app settings. Uses secure backend delivery (SMTP/Resend).

### For Savers (Vault Owners)
---

## 📧 Email Notification System

SpendGuard includes a built-in email notification system for important vault and guardian events:

- **Events Covered:**
   - Withdrawal request submitted
   - Withdrawal approved
   - Withdrawal rejected
   - Withdrawal executed
   - Emergency unlock requested
- **Opt-in:** Users can provide their email and manage notification preferences in the Settings page.
- **Backend:** Uses SMTP (Nodemailer) or Resend API for secure delivery. Emails are only sent to users who have opted in.
- **Customization:** Email templates can be customized in `lib/services/email-notifications.ts`.

**How it works:**
1. User sets their email and notification preferences in Settings.
2. When a covered event occurs, the backend checks preferences and sends notifications to all involved parties.
3. Emails include event details, vault info, and relevant links.

**Environment setup:**
Set SMTP or Resend credentials in your environment:

```
SMTP_HOST=smtp.example.com
SMTP_PORT=587
SMTP_USER=your_smtp_user
SMTP_PASS=your_smtp_pass
SMTP_FROM="SpendGuard <no-reply@spendguard.xyz>"
```

Or configure Resend API as needed.

---

- ✅ **Create Vault**: Deploy your own SpendVault contract with custom quorum settings
- ✅ **Manage Guardians**: Add/remove trusted friends with soulbound tokens (non-transferable)
- ✅ **Request Withdrawals**: Create withdrawal requests with reason explanations
- ✅ **Track Activity**: View all withdrawal history and guardian votes
- ✅ **Emergency Mode**: Request emergency unlock (30-day timelock for solo access)
- ✅ **Multi-Asset Support**: Store ETH and ERC-20 tokens (USDC, DEGEN, etc.)

### 💰 Spending Limits

SpendGuard includes sophisticated spending limit controls to enforce daily, weekly, and monthly withdrawal caps per token:

- **Granular Limits**: Set separate daily, weekly, and monthly caps for each token
- **Enhanced Approvals**: Withdrawals exceeding limits automatically require 75% of guardians to approve (instead of standard quorum)
- **Real-Time Monitoring**: Dashboard shows current spending vs limits with color-coded warnings:
  - 🟢 **Safe** (< 75%): Green progress bar
  - 🟡 **Warning** (75-95%): Yellow progress bar
  - 🔴 **Critical** (> 95%): Red progress bar
- **Temporal Resets**: Daily limits reset every 24 hours, weekly every 7 days, monthly on the 1st
- **Smart Defaults**: Set limits based on vault's daily operational needs (e.g., $1000/day, $10,000/week, $50,000/month)

**Use Case**: Protect against compromised accounts or malicious insiders by requiring additional consensus for large withdrawals.

### ⏰ Time-Locked Withdrawals

SpendGuard protects large withdrawals with an automatic time-lock mechanism that forces a review period:

- **Smart Queuing**: Withdrawals exceeding a configurable threshold (default 1000 ETH) are automatically queued instead of executed immediately
- **Guardian Review Window**: 2-day (configurable) delay period where guardians can freeze suspicious transactions
- **Multi-Guardian Freeze**: Any guardian can freeze a withdrawal, and it stays frozen until **ALL** freezing guardians approve its execution
- **Smart Execution**: Once the delay expires and no guardian has frozen it, anyone can execute (permissionless execution)
- **Owner Emergency Cancel**: Owner can cancel any queued withdrawal at any time without waiting for delay
- **Per-Token Configuration**: Set different thresholds for different tokens (e.g., high threshold for stablecoins, lower for rare tokens)

**Statuses:**
- 🟡 **Pending**: Queued, waiting for time-lock delay
- 🟢 **Ready**: Delay expired, ready for execution
- 🔒 **Frozen**: Guardians froze it for manual review
- ✅ **Executed**: Successfully executed and withdrawn
- ❌ **Cancelled**: Owner or signers cancelled it

**Use Case**: Prevent large treasury withdrawals from being executed without proper oversight. Gives guardian team time to investigate unusual withdrawal patterns and consensus-block suspicious transactions.

### 🚨 Emergency Freeze Mechanism

SpendGuard includes an emergency freeze feature that allows guardians to quickly respond to suspicious activity:

- **Majority-Based Freeze**: Any majority of guardians can vote to temporarily freeze the vault
- **Immediate Action**: Blocks all withdrawals and sensitive operations instantly when threshold reached
- **Transparent Voting**: Real-time vote tracking shows all guardians' positions
- **Recovery Path**: Guardians can vote to unfreeze once threat is resolved
- **Vote Flexibility**: Guardians can change their vote before freeze occurs or switch between freeze/unfreeze

**Freeze States:**
- 🟢 **Normal**: Vault operating normally, all functions available
- 🟡 **In Progress**: Guardians voting to freeze, withdrawals still blocked
- 🔒 **Frozen**: Majority voted to freeze, all withdrawals blocked
- 🔓 **Unfreezing**: Guardians voting to unfreeze, waiting for majority approval

**Voting Rules:**
- Threshold = (Guardian Count ÷ 2) + 1 (mathematical majority)
- Example: 3 guardians need 2 votes to freeze or unfreeze
- Each guardian can only vote once per direction (can revoke votes before freeze)
- Non-guardians cannot participate in voting

**Use Case**: Protect against compromised guardians or suspicious activity patterns. If you detect unusual withdrawal attempts or suspect account compromise, any majority of guardians can immediately freeze the vault while investigating.

### Contract Interactions

1. **Vault Creation**: VaultFactory deploys a new SpendVault + GuardianSBT pair
2. **Guardian Setup**: Owner mints SBTs to trusted friends
3. **Withdrawal Flow**:
   - Owner requests withdrawal
   - Guardians sign with EIP-712 (off-chain)
   - Owner submits transaction with signatures
   - Contract verifies signatures and guardian status
   - Funds transfer on success

- Only owner can mint/burn tokens
- Used for identity verification in SpendVault
- **Multi-Vault Associations**: Each guardian token can be linked to multiple SpendVault addresses. Guardians can serve in multiple vaults.

**Main Functions**:
```solidity
function mint(address to, address vault) external onlyOwner
function burn(uint256 tokenId, address vault) external onlyOwner
function balanceOf(address account) external view returns (uint256)
function getVaultsForGuardian(address guardian) external view returns (address[] memory)
function getGuardiansForVault(address vault) external view returns (address[] memory)
```

**Multi-Vault Guardian Associations**:
- Guardians can be associated with multiple vaults.
- Query all vaults for a guardian, or all guardians for a vault.

### SpendVault.sol

**Purpose**: Multi-sig treasury vault with guardian-based withdrawals

**Key Features**:
- Holds ETH and ERC-20 tokens
- Requires N-of-M guardian signatures for withdrawals
- EIP-712 signature verification
- Nonce-based replay protection

### Simulation Mode (Frontend-Only Demo)

SpendGuard includes a built-in simulation mode for demo and education purposes. This mode lets you experience the full vault recovery and guardian approval flow **without sending any onchain transactions**.

**How to Use Simulation Mode:**

1. **Toggle Simulation:**
   - Use the "Simulation: ON/OFF" button in the top navigation bar to enable or disable simulation mode.
2. **Demo Panel:**
   - When enabled, a floating panel appears in the bottom-right corner.
   - Simulate guardian approvals, start an emergency unlock countdown, and see the recovery success state.
3. **No Blockchain Required:**
   - All actions in simulation mode are handled in the frontend only. No real transactions are sent.
   - All onchain actions in the UI are blocked while simulation is active.

**Simulation Features:**
- Simulate vault owner loss of access
- Guardian approval workflow
- Emergency unlock countdown (demo duration)
- Recovery success state
- No wallet or blockchain required

This is ideal for onboarding, demos, and testing the user experience without risk.

## 🛠️ Development

### Available Scripts

```bash
# Development
npm run dev          # Start dev server (localhost:3000)
npm run build        # Build for production
npm run start        # Start production server
npm run lint         # Run ESLint

npx hardhat compile      # Compile contracts
npx hardhat test         # Run contract tests
npx hardhat node         # Start local blockchain
```

## 🔐 Server & Encrypted DB

- The app now stores guardian pending requests and account activities server-side using a SQLite database (server-only). The DB is encrypted using AES-256-GCM; the encryption key must be provided via `DB_ENCRYPTION_KEY` in your environment.
- Install the native SQLite dependency on the server: `better-sqlite3` is required for the server-side service.
- Migration: if you have existing on-chain cached activity data, an import endpoint and helper script are provided. To re-encrypt or import data, run the migration script (if present) and set `DB_ENCRYPTION_KEY` prior to running:

```bash
# Ensure env contains DB_ENCRYPTION_KEY
npm run encrypt-db
```

Files of interest:
- `lib/services/guardian-signature-db.ts` — encrypted DB layer and API helpers
- `app/api/activities` — server endpoints for listing/importing activities

## 🛡️ GuardianBadge (Soulbound NFT)

- A non-transferable `GuardianBadge` ERC-721 contract (soulbound) was added to help surface guardian achievements in the UI.
- To enable badge display in the dashboard, set the deployed contract address for your network in `lib/contracts.ts` under `GUARDIAN_BADGE_ADDRESS` (e.g. `baseSepolia: '0xYOUR_ADDRESS'`).
- There is a server endpoint that computes badge eligibility recommendations at `/api/badges/eligible` — minting is manual (owner) or can be automated with a secure signer.

Files of interest:
- `contracts/GuardianBadge.sol` — the soulbound badge contract
- `lib/abis/GuardianBadge.json` and `lib/abis/GuardianBadge.ts` — ABI and wrapper
- `lib/hooks/useContracts.ts` — client hooks for reading badges and minting (owner)

## 🧭 Activity Log Troubleshooting

If the Activity page shows "No Activity Yet" even when you expect events, try the following steps:

- 1) Verify Vault addresses are discovered
   - Open the browser console and look for logs prefixed with `[ActivityLogView]` and `[useVaultActivity]` to confirm `vaultAddress` and `guardianTokenAddress` are populated.

- 2) Check the server API
   - Request server-side activities for a vault:

```bash
curl "http://localhost:3000/api/activities?account=0xYOUR_VAULT_ADDRESS" | jq '.'
```

   - A non-empty JSON array indicates the server has activity records. If the array is empty, the UI will fall back to on-chain event scanning.

- 3) Confirm on-chain events are being fetched
   - The client scans the vault contract for `Deposited` and `Withdrawn` events. Look for logs like `[useDepositHistory] Decoded log:` in the browser console.
   - If no logs appear, ensure `NEXT_PUBLIC_RPC_URL` points to a working Base Sepolia RPC and that the vault has emitted events.

- 4) Check local caches and auto-import
   - The client stores caches under keys like `deposits-cache-<vault>` and `deposits-debug-<vault>` in `localStorage`. Inspect these keys if you want debug information.
   - On first load the app attempts an automatic import of recent on-chain activity to the server. It sets a local flag `activities-migrated-<vaultAddress>` to avoid repeating imports.

- 5) Server-side DB & encryption
   - Make sure the server process has `DB_ENCRYPTION_KEY` set; otherwise encrypted DB access will fail.
   - If you recently changed the key, run the migration/encrypt script:

```bash
# Set DB_ENCRYPTION_KEY in your environment, then:
npm run encrypt-db
```

- 6) Force import (advanced)
   - The client calls an import endpoint to persist activities server-side. If needed, you can POST activity objects to `/api/activities/import` (JSON array) to seed the DB.

If you still see no activity after these checks, paste the browser console logs and the output of the `curl` command above and I will help diagnose further.


### Adding New Features

1. **New Contract Function**:
   - Update `contracts/SpendVault.sol`
   - Recompile: `npx hardhat compile`
   - Update ABI in `lib/abis/`
   - Add hook in `lib/hooks/useContracts.ts`

2. **New UI Component**:
   - Create component in `components/[category]/`
   - Import in relevant page: `app/[route]/page.tsx`
   - Use Wagmi hooks for blockchain interactions

3. **New Page Route**:
   - Create folder: `app/[route]/`
   - Add `page.tsx` file
   - Update navigation in `components/layout/navbar.tsx`

### Code Style

- **TypeScript**: Strict mode enabled
- **React**: Functional components with hooks
- **Styling**: Tailwind utility classes
- **Web3**: Wagmi hooks for all blockchain calls
- **Error Handling**: Try-catch blocks for async operations

## 📦 Deployment

### Frontend Deployment (Vercel)

```bash
# Install Vercel CLI
npm i -g vercel

# Deploy to production
vercel --prod

# Set environment variables in Vercel dashboard
```

### Contract Deployment (Base Sepolia)

See detailed guide in [DEPLOYMENT.md](DEPLOYMENT.md)

**Quick Deploy**:

```bash
# Install Hardhat
npm install --save-dev hardhat @nomicfoundation/hardhat-toolbox

# Configure .env
PRIVATE_KEY=your_private_key
BASESCAN_API_KEY=your_api_key

# Deploy contracts
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.ts --network baseSepolia

# Verify on BaseScan
npx hardhat verify --network baseSepolia DEPLOYED_ADDRESS
```

**Post-Deployment**:
1. Copy contract addresses to `.env.local`
2. Update `lib/config.ts` with addresses
3. Test on testnet before mainnet launch

## 🔒 Security

### Smart Contract Security

✅ **Implemented Protections**:
- Reentrancy guards on withdrawal functions
- Signature replay protection via nonces
- Zero-address checks on all transfers
- Ownable pattern for access control
- EIP-712 for structured signature data
- Soulbound tokens prevent guardian trading

⚠️ **Security Considerations**:
- Contracts are unaudited (testnet only)
- Guardian collusion risk (choose trustworthy friends)
- Emergency unlock is irrevocable after 30 days
- Private key security is user's responsibility

### Audit Status

🚧 **Not yet audited** - Use at your own risk

Recommended auditors for future:
- OpenZeppelin
- Trail of Bits
- Consensys Diligence

### Best Practices

1. **Choose Guardians Wisely**: Select friends who won't collude
2. **Set Appropriate Quorum**: Higher quorum = more security, less convenience
3. **Test on Testnet**: Try full workflow before mainnet
4. **Backup Keys**: Store recovery phrases securely
5. **Monitor Activity**: Check dashboard regularly for suspicious requests

---

## 🧪 Testing

### Manual Testing Flow

1. **Connect Wallet**: Use MetaMask on Base Sepolia
2. **Create Vault**: 
   - Click "Create Vault"
   - Set quorum (e.g., 2 of 3)
   - Confirm transaction
3. **Add Guardians**:
   - Enter 3 guardian addresses
   - Mint SBTs to each
4. **Deposit Funds**:
   - Send ETH or tokens to vault
5. **Request Withdrawal**:
   - Fill withdrawal form
   - Submit request
6. **Guardian Approval**:
   - Switch to guardian account
   - View pending request
   - Sign approval (2 guardians)
7. **Execute Withdrawal**:
   - Switch back to owner
   - Submit transaction with signatures

### Running Locally

```bash
# Start development server
npm run dev

# Open http://localhost:3000 in your browser
```

### Building for Production

```bash
# Create optimized build
npm run build

# Start production server
npm run start
```
